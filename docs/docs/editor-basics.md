### 3D view

This is the standard view. It shows you your keyboard.

### Keys view

Shows you all the keys in a top down view.

### Program view

This view shows you how you could wire the keyboard and lets you download the KLE Layout.

### Base view

This view shows you the base of the keyboard with the screw locations for the baseplate and the board holder.

### Thickness view

This view shows you, how thick the shell is in certain places, and where it might be too thin.

## Opacity slider

This slider changes the opacity of the keys and the baseplate. You can check, how your shell and the microcontroller look here.

### Switch and keycap size

With the bar at the top, you can select which switch you are using, and the keycap size. You can also delete the key here.

### Keycap

#### Profile

Allows you to select, what profile the keycap uses.

#### Row

Some keycap profiles have different keycaps for different rows to be more comfortable.

#### Homing

**Todo** doesn't seem to make any visual difference?

#### Letter

The letter to be shown on this keycap

### Key position

The row and column allow you to align the keys to the grid.
The offset offsetts the keys from the position given by the row and column.
The rotation rotates the key in it's position. The rotation set in the curvature panel is not shown here.
See [curvature](./configuration.md#curvature) for that.

## Filament information

![filament info](../assets/filament-info.png)

Shows you how much filament printing your keyboard would take.
The cost estimation seems to be based on a price of about 40$ per kilogram.
