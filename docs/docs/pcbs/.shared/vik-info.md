???info "What's VIK?"

    [VIK](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik) is a standard for how keyboard modules connect to one another. It combines SPI, I2C, power, and GPIO into a single connector. You'll use it for connecting things like trackballs, trackpads, displays, and more. The idea is that the Cosmos benefits from VIK modules for other keyboards, and any VIK modules created specifically for Cosmos will benefit the wider keyboard community,
